# UK-Parliament-Division-Tracker
Contains functionality to pull voting data from UK House of Commons and create graph objects from NetworkX package that can be analysed further.


This project was inspired by Matthew O. Jackson's book "The Human Network" which featured an analysis of votes in the U.S. Senate performed by Renzo Lucioni that can be accessed here: https://renzo.lucioni.xyz/senate-voting-relationships/ 

I am using historical voting data from the UK parliament made available via the Public Whip project (https://www.publicwhip.org.uk/) to illustrate voting behaviour via NetworkX graphs that are rendered using Gephi.
